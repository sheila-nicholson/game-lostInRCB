Ignore if I'm here for the 4pm later today*
Didn't want to discord message only to disturb y'all
I'm not in the country and thus cannot join the call, should be back Monday/Tuesday.
Forgot to push before I had to urgently leave.
Documentation's well taken care of, but I'm a bit stuck/confused about UI.
Spent a few hours googling and youtubing - can someone assist?
I'll pitch in wherever needed as a result if necessary.
