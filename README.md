# The Game: Escape from RCB
The main character of the game is a student attending SFU. In the midst of
finals season, they unintentionally slip into a deep slumber. Utterly exhausted from constant
studying, assignment deadlines, and cramming of missed lectures, they slowly blink their eyes
open and are shocked to find themselves lost in the deep, dark maze known as Robert C. Brown
Hall. The player must evade a rabid bear, a zombie professor, or a failed exam to make their way
out. With the help of copious amounts of caffeine, ever-moving A+ papers, and a cozy bed or
two along the way, they just might be able to escape from the labyrinth that is Robert C. Brown
Hall. That is, if they are not defeated by the many piles of books, vortexes that respawn the
student's location, and the decelerating hidden smoke.

Game Objective: Collect all reward items (A+ papers, coffees, beds) and exit the level. The game
ends if the player is caught by the enemy or if their score becomes negative.
